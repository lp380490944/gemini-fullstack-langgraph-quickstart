# === Optional: Basic Auth for the frontend (/app) ===
# When set, the FastAPI middleware will require HTTP Basic auth for /app
APP_BASIC_AUTH_USER=
APP_BASIC_AUTH_PASS=

# === Optional: Frontend API base (compile-time for Vite) ===
# Only needed if your API is not the same origin as the frontend.
# If empty, frontend falls back to window.location.origin at runtime.
VITE_API_URL=

# === Optional: Proxies for outbound traffic (runtime) ===
# Prefer socks5h so DNS also goes through the proxy, e.g. socks5h://user:pass@proxy-host:1080

HTTP_PROXY=
# Do not proxy internal service names and localhost
NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost,langgraph-redis,langgraph-postgres

# === Optional: Database/Cache (runtime) ===
# In docker-compose these are already provided; only override if you run standalone.
REDIS_URI=redis://localhost:6379
POSTGRES_URI=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable

# === Notes for CI (build-time proxies) ===
# In GitHub Actions, set these as Secrets or Variables if your CI needs a proxy to build:
#   BUILD_ALL_PROXY, BUILD_HTTPS_PROXY, BUILD_HTTP_PROXY, BUILD_NO_PROXY
# They are passed to Docker build as build-args by .github/workflows/docker-image.yml.
